# music-genre-classifier-using-5-ML-classifiers
ML model to predict the genre of songs
Our project is a classifier that can classify songs into 10 genres
 namely: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hiphop, Jazz, Metal, Pop,
 Reggae, and Rock.
Dataset Description: The dataset is provided in this link
 (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/189jIlfQ-E94eHfKVksbAUSXKX68Ju1GI). The link contains two csv files. One
 with audio files with 3 second duration and the other with 30 seconds
 duration. There are 58 features and 1000 records. There are 100
 songs from every genre (totally 1000 songs from 10 genres).
Classifiers Used: We have used 5 ML classifiers namely: Support
 Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN), Naive Bayes,
 Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Random Forest is an ensemble
 model.
We have calculated the Accuracy, Precision, F-Measure, and Recall
 values with all the above mentioned classifiers for the entire dataset
 and each target class.
